Two players:
- one attacker (robber)
- 3 defenders (police)
Players move in a grid-like city map represented as an undirected graph. Each node
can have at most 4 neighbors and at least one. The attacker starts at a random node
which is called a hideout. Defenders start at random nodes which are not the hideout. Each
defender has to be on a different node. The goal of the attacker is attack as many targets as possible before
being caught. After a target is attacked it becomes unavailable. To collect the reward for a given target, he
needs to come back to the hideout before he can attack again. The goal of the defenders is to catch the attacker.
Each policeman can arrest one of neighboring nodes or the node that he is currently on. If the attacker is on the arrested
node, he is caught and the game ends. Game also ends if the attacker collects all rewards or after a fixed number of time steps.
Attacker can move through defenders unnoticed, even if he ends his turn on a node occupied by a defender.
Attacker can:
- move to one of the neighboring nodes
- attack a node that he is currently on, but only if it is a target that has not been attacked yet and he didn't attack any other target before reaching the hideout
Defender can:
- move to one of the neighboring nodes (as long as no other defender is there)
- arrest neighboring node or the node that he is currently on
- check if the attacker visited a given neighboring node or the node that he is currently on in the last k turns
