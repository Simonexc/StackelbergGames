Rules:
1. Flip action attempts to take control of a node:
    a) Flip action has associated cost for a given node; the cost is incurred regardless of outcome of the action.
    b) If a node is controlled by the player making the flip, it remains theirs.
    c) If a node is flipped by both players and for both players this node is reachable (Rule 1.e), the owner of that node remains unchanged.
    d) If a node is reachable (Rule 1.e) and situation from Rule 1.c does not occur, it becomes theirs.
    e) Player can only flip a node if it is reachable for them:
        i) For attacker, any entry node is reachable (marked with green in the graph).
        ii) For attacker, any node (other than entry node) is reachable if and only if they control at least one predecessor of the node.
        iii) For defender, any node is reachable if and only if they control at least one successor of the node.
        iv) Reachability is evaluated before any flip actions are performed.
    f) The player is not aware whether the flip was successful or not.
2. Observe action reveals the current owner of a node:
    a) Observe action has no cost.
    b) The observe action is performed always after flip action.
    c) The player can observe any node, regardless of reachability.
    d) The observe action is always successful and the player is aware of the result.
3. At a given step, each player can perform one action (flip or observe) on one node.
4. Both players perform actions simultaneously.
5. After each step, both players receive rewards for controlling nodes reduced by costs of actions.
    a) Each controlled node gives a reward specified for that node to the player controlling it.
6. Both players have full information about the topology of the graph and the rewards/costs for each node.
6. The game ends after m steps.
    a) The player with the highest cumulative reward wins.
