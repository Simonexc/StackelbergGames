Rules:
1. Move action attempts to move player to a neighboring node:
    a) Move action has a fixed cost associated with it.
    b) Player can only move to its neighboring nodes.
    c) Both defender and attacker have the same rules for moving.
2. Track action allows player to check if and when the opponent last visited this node:
    a) Track action has no cost.
    b) Player can track only node that it stands on.
    c) The track action is always successful and the player is aware of the result.
    d) Both defender and attacker have the same rules for moving.
3. Prepare action allows player to increase the reward for the reward node:
    a) Prepare action has a cost associated with it for a given reward node.
    b) It increase the value of the reward node by a fixed amount (separate for each node).
    c) Can only be performed by attacker on reward nodes only if the attacker stands on the node.
4. Collect action allows player to collect the reward from the reward node:
    a) Collect action has no cost.
    b) Can only be performed by attacker on reward nodes only if the attacker stands on the node.
    c) After performing collect action, the reward node becomes empty and cannot be collected again.
    d) The same value of the reward is subtracted from the total possible reward of the defender (which is the sum of all reward nodes).
5. The goal of the game for attackers is to collect as much reward as possible,
   while for defenders is to prevent attackers from collecting rewards.
6. The attacker can be caught by the defender if the defender stands on the same node as the attacker.
7. The game ends when all reward nodes are empty, attacker is caught, or after m steps.
8. At each turn the player knows at which node it stands and the current step number.
